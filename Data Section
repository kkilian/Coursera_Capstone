I am going to use 'collisions in Seattle' dataset to build my model. There are several features which can help with getting better grasp on the topic.
Firstly we need to understand significance of these features, each idividual. Dataset contains weather data, data about light conditions, road conditions,
about juncion type etc.We need to have in mind our main objective - building ML model to help authorities reduce number of accidents.
